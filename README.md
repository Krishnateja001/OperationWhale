# #Operation Whale

**Problem:** Collisions between fast moving ships and whales pose a profound threat to the species. Since June 2017, at least 12 right whales have been found dead in Canadaâ€™s Gulf of St. Lawrence. A report analyzing the first six deaths found that five of the whales were probably killed by blunt force trauma.

**Solution:** Develop a web application that detects the sounds of whales, identify the whale species and alerts the ship captains to reduce ship speed to 10-12 knots when the marine mammals are present.
